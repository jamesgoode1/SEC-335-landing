Host Discovery (Lab 2.1)

Ping Script

#!/bin/bash
for ip in {2..50}; do ping -c 1 -W 1 10.0.5.$ip | grep "bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" >> sweep.txt


Fping

#!/bin/bash
sudo fping -a -g 10.0.5.2 10.0.5.50 2>/dev/null >> sweep2.txt

Nmap Range Scan

#!/bin/bash
sudo nmap -sn 10.0.5.2-50 | grep "Nmap scan report" | awk '{print $5}' >> sweep3.txt


Reflection: 

Ping: Simple and effective for individual hosts but requires extra processing with grep, cut, and tr.

Fping: Using (2>/dev/null) to suppress errors  made the results cleaner.

Nmap: More detailed host discovery and requires administrative privileges. It uses of TCP and ICMP as opposed to ping and fping icmp.
