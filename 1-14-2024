Passive reconnaissance is an important step in ethical hacking, where information is gathered from publicly available sources without directly interacting with a target system. This method helps ethical hackers understand a target's infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities. By focusing on being non-intrusive passive reconnaissance minimizes the risk of detection while providing valuable insights. Common tools used include DNS tools like dig and nslookup for discovering subdomains and services.
