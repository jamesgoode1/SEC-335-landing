The hardest part of this challenge was initially locating the admin credentials. Enumerating deep directories using Gobuster and Dirb was essential. I learned how dangerous open directories and exposed databases can be, especially when weak hashing is used. In the future, I want to explore how to use tamper scripts in SQLMap to get around WAFs.
