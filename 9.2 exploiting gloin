Database

SELECT * FROM admin_list;

Username: Administrator
Hash: 4214db3884e9cd913b49b5b44e49ae96

Cracking the Password
I saved the hash to a file called hashes.txt and used John the Ripper to crack it:
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
The password was successfully cracked: Moria2Featon6

ssh Administrator@10.0.5.31

User Flag
Located is gloins directory in C:\Users\gloin\user-flag.txt

Root Flag

Already had Administrator privileges from the login. Found the root flag in C:\root-flag.txt

The hardest part of this challenge was initially locating the admin credentials and using Gobuster and Dirb was essential. 
I learned how dangerous open directories and exposed databases can be, especially when weak hashing is used. 
I also prtacticed some basic sql injection commands when looking for another way to find the database file.
